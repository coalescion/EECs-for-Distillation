# EECs-for-Distillation
In this repository, we investigate whether effective error channels (EECs) can be defined on the logical level to model the Clifford-level noise associated with QEC-encoded circuits. Specifically, we construct EECs for a Steane-encoded magic-state distillation circuit via quantum process tomography, and simulate the logical circuit with these EECs.

The main notebook is ```eastin_encoding_optimize.ipynb```. Here, we create the LogicalQubit class for Steane encoding, define and test QEC functions, construct effective error channels, save the results to pickle files, and plot per vs ler for our constructed EECs. In ```eastin_circ_w_eec.ipynb```, we simulate Eastin's |H>-to-Toffoli distillation circuit (2013) with and without our EECs (that model encoded Clifford-level noise), and obtain plots for the acceptance probability and output error probability of the circuit.
