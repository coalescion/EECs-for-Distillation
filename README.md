# EECs-for-Distillation
Investigating whether effective error channels (EECs) can be defined on the logical level to model the Clifford-level noise associated with QEC-encoded circuits. Specifically, we construct EECs for a Steane-encoded magic-state distillation circuit via quantum process tomography, and simulate the logical circuit with these EECs.
